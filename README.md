Agenda 12-03-2019

* [Mandatory Assignment: Required readings List](https://github.com/python-elective-2-spring-2019/Lesson-07-Required-reading-Exercise/tree/master/exercises)

## Todays agenda
Today you are going to show your mandatory assignment to me (Claus).  
> See me as your boss who gave you this task of creating the application. My wish is ofcause to ship this to my customers as fast as possible, and give you another application to work on. If you present this as a finnished solution, and we then on a later point get a lot of complaints from the customers, you will get the blame. So it is probably best to be honest :)

You will be evaluated with a 'passed' or 'failed'.  
Besides that the main focus is on giving you feedback. What is good, what could be better, seen from the perspective off: 
* did you learn anything, and 
* what is expected at the filnal exam. 

## Timeframe
You are 41 in this class, 3 has legal reasons for not being here. (so 38). We have 135 minutes for the evaluations. That gives each off you a little more than 3 minutes. 

Use the time on:
* Show me what your application can do
* Explain to me what does not work.
